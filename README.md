### RAP1: Matrix Group Orbits  
**Problem**: Count orbits of 4-tuples of 1000×1000 involutory matrices under $GL(1000)$ conjugation with specific braid relations.

**Solution Method**:
- Analyze the Coxeter-type group structure with path pattern $A_1 — A_2 — A_4 — A_3$
- Study eigenspace constraints from braid relations
